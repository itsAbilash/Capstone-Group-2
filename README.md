# Capstone Project - AI-Driven LLM Agent for Data WorkFlow

## Description
This project implements an AI-powered chatbot for vehicle data workflow. It enables users to query vehicle-related information, fetches data from relevant websites and displays it in user-friendly formats.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (recommended: 3.9 or above)
- Conda package manager
- Microsoft Edge browser
- Streamlit (installed via the `environment.yml`)

## Setup
1. Create and activate the Conda environment: 
conda env create -f environment.yml conda activate capstone

2. The `config.json` file provided in the project directory already contains the required API key. No additional setup is needed for API configuration.

## Running the Project
Run the chatbot using Streamlit:
streamlit run ccc_ai_agent.py

The command above assumes you are in the correct directory. If you are not, provide the relative or absolute path to `ccc_ai_agent.py`.
e.g.: streamlit run /path/to/ccc_project/ccc_ai_agent.py

This will open the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

## Testing Selenium (Optional)
To verify that Selenium and the WebDriver are configured correctly, run the test script: 
python selenium_test.py

This will open a browser, navigate to Google, and print the page title in the console.

## Troubleshooting
1. **Streamlit Issues**:
   - Ensure you are running the command from the activated `capstone` environment.
   - If Streamlit is not recognized, check the environment setup and re-install it:
     ```
     conda install streamlit
     ```

2. **Selenium Issues**:
   - Ensure Microsoft Edge is installed and updated.
   - If WebDriver fails, download the correct version of the Edge WebDriver from the official Microsoft website.
